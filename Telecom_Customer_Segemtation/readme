Alternative credit scoring refers to the use of data from digital platforms and applications on consumer behavior for credit risk assessment. 
In the past, credit bureaus were the sole source of consumer credit information, which lending institutions use to reduce bad debt and market risk.  
Alternative credit scoring demonstrates the potential strength of combining data from multiple sources, like airtime usage, mobile money usage, 
geolocation, bills payment history, and social media usage.
